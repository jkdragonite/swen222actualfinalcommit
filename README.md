Welcome to Existential Dread!
Existential dread is a very real condition often experienced by those studying Engineering and Computer Science at
Victoria University of Wellington. This game is a cause but also an exploration of existential dread. 

To run the game currently you run the NetworkTesting class, and then run the Servant class for 
a client to pop up. 
The Main class also provides an option to run from the command line but unfortunately the sockets protest even though
it's the same as NetworkTesting. If you wanted to try it, you run -server plus the number of clients (no idea how to
make it work for more than one client because I don't even know how to network still. 
If you want to run a client you pass -connect and the address. 

Once the game is ready to go, all player movement is handled by the buttons on the GUI. Player actions are also 
controlled by buttons on the GUI. In order to go through a door you need to navigate to the door, press use and 
then use door to go to the next room. 
Pickup/Drop items are fairly self-explanatory. TO get more information on an item in you inventory, press the 
button under the picture corresponding to the item. The information is displayed above the use button. 
Certain items in the game world can be pushed and pulled using the buttons: find one and relive Sokoban, 
because who didn't love that game. 

Have fun. Or not. This is about existential dread, after all...
